# Fraud-Detection-Project

Fraud attempts have seen a drastic increase in recent years, making fraud detection is more important than ever. For instance, recent research shows a typical organization loses 5% of revenues each year because of fraud with a median loss of $145,000 per case. Consequently in this project, weâ€™re interested in Fraud Detection, and we will figure out an ML-based way for recognizing fraud activities with several features given. Notice that this should be a classification problem.

In general, this project will be composed of 4 parts: (Notice that this part also includes corresponding Member contributions)

- Data Exploration & Data Preprocessing 
- Feature Selection & Dimension Reduction 
- Modeling with various techniques: Xgboost and Random Forest, Logistic regression, Decision tree
- Model Performance Evaluation & Comparison

Key questions about the dataset:

- How are a fraud and non-fraud classes different from each other?
- When does fraud events tend to occur?
- Which variable has the most contribution to our model?
- What is the best model among these 4 modeling methodologies(model comparison)?
